# Factories

Factories are design patterns that:

1. Provide a standardized way to create objects
2. Manage object construction and destruction
3. Are particularly useful for scenarios with repetitive object creation

## Key Use Cases:

- Building complex objects consistently
- Managing object lifecycles
- Simplifying test setup, especially for authentication scenarios

## Benefits in Testing:

- Streamline creation of test objects
- Ensure consistency across test cases
- Facilitate easy mocking of authorized users
