# TheMarketplace - Community Trading Platform

## Overview

TheMarketplace is a .NET 8 web API backend for a community-based buy/sell/trade platform. The system provides a structured approach to marketplace operations using a hierarchical model: **Listings** contain **Cards**, which contain **Products** with detailed information.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
- **Listings**: Top-level collections that organise trading items
- **Cards**: Visual containers within listings that group related products
- **Products**: Individual items/services with detailed specifications
- **Product Details**: Extended information including media and documents
- **User Management**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8** - Modern C# runtime with minimal API architecture
- **[WolverineFx](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine)** - Message bus for CQRS pattern implementation
- **Entity Framework Core 8** - Data access layer with Code First approach
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** - User authentication and authorisation
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **SQL Server 2022** - Primary database (containerised)
- **AutoMapper** - Object-to-object mapping
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** - API documentation and testing
- **xUnit & Alba** - Unit and integration testing framework
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerisation for development

- Real-time notifications
- Performance optimisations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Docker Desktop
- SQL Server Management Studio (optional)

### Quick Start

1. **Start the database**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project Marketplace.Data --startup-project Marketplace.Api
   ```

3. **Start the API**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Marketplace.Api
   ```

4. **Access Swagger UI**
   - Navigate to: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`
   - Database connection: `Server=127.0.0.1,1433;User=sa;Password=P@ssw0rd!`

### Development Setup

The solution follows a clean architecture pattern with four main projects:

- **Marketplace.Api** - Web API layer with endpoints and configuration
- **Marketplace.Core** - Business logic and shared utilities
- **Marketplace.Data** - Data access layer with EF Core
- **Marketplace.Test** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organisation
- Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture
- Use the mediator pattern via WolverineFx
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Maintain API documentation via Swagger
- Follow conventional commits for version control

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Input validation and sanitisation
- SQL injection prevention via EF Core
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Role-based access control

### Performance Guidelines
- Use async/await for all database operations
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimise database queries with proper indexing
